**The philosophers dinner problem**

* there are a table and there are philosophers around it
* the philo must eat or think or sleep, they should do one process
* every philo must have his own fork
* the philo must eat with two forks, his left and right fork
* if the philo finished eating, he puts their forks on the table and start sleeping, once awake he start thinking
* the program stops when a philo dies of starvation
* (eating -> sleeping -> thinking)

==============================================

* program arguments :
./philo   number_of_philo   time_to_die(ms)   time_to_eat(ms)   time_to_sleep(ms)   time_to_eat(optional)

* each philo has number ranging form 1 ro N
* philo number N sits next to philo N-1 and N+1
